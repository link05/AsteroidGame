<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Game refers to Asteroid Mockup Game which I have created using Java and Codenameone.
<br><br>To see source code go to <em>game->src->com/mycompany/a3</em>
<br>This project includes:<br>
    1). Source code files<br>
    2). Sound files(for when missles are fired, asteroids destoryed...)<br>
    
This project is done using MVC, along with command design pattern.
<br>

To get better idea I have taken the liberty to do the UML diagram for the source code:
